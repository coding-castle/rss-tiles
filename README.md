# RSS Tiles

This is a minimalistic RSS news reader which I built over a free weekend, although I might implement more features over time.

So far it only features German sources which I handpicked for a few categories (so yes it's biased).

## API

This project makes use of an rss --> json [API](https://rss2json.com).
Many APIs that directly deliver news are either very limited for the free tier or outright too expensive for a small project like this.

## Development

You can clone this repo and install the dependencies with an `npm install`. After the installation finishes run `ng serve -o` to start the app locally.

To access the API you need to create an account to get an API key (its free!). Then you can add news sources of your liking.
